# meta/main.yml — openclaw_harden role

galaxy_info:
  author: defilan
  description: >-
    Applies security hardening to an already-deployed OpenClaw instance
    on macOS.  Uses a read-merge-write strategy for openclaw.json so
    that onboarding-generated values are preserved.  Hardens file
    permissions, templates the .env file, and ensures the sandbox
    Docker image is available.
